### What is React? And why would you use it?

1. Its a JS library for building UI.
2. Using JS typically isn't a great option:
   1. Writing complex js code quickly becomes cumbersome
   2. Complex js code quickly becomes error-prone
   3. Complex js code often is hard to maintain or edit
   4. React offers a simpler mental model
3. React = Declarative UI Programming (DEFINE THE GOAL NOT THE STEPS). Meaning with react you define the target UI state(s) - not the steps to get there! Instead, React will figure out & perform the necessary steps
4. JS = Imperative; DEFINE THE STEPS, NOT THE GOAL.
